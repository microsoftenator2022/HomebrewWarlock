# HomebrewWarlock (name pending)

My attempt at porting 3.5e Complete Arcane's Warlock to WotR.

Mild changes were made in a few areas to fit better with PF1e and WotR. eg. some 24h invocations are now permanent, some are toggled intead.
Where possible I have tried to use Pathfinder equivalents for spells and feats.

## Currently implemented

All base class features except Imbue Item (crafting). Will be implemented for the final release.

### Invocations
#### Least

- Beguiling influence
- Dark One's Own Luck
- Eldritch Glaive (eldritch blast shape, Dragon Magic)

- Frightful Blast (eldritch blast essence)
- Hideous Blow (eldritch blast shape)
- See the Unseen
- Sickening Blast (eldritch blast essence)
- Summon Swarm (Spiders)

#### Lesser
- Beshadowed Blast (eldritch blast essence)
- Brimstone Blast (eldritch blast essence)
- Curse of Despair
- Eldritch Chain (eldritch blast shape)
- Fell Flight
- Hellrime Blast (eldritch blast essence)

#### Greater
- Bewitching Blast (eldritch blast essence)

- Devour Magic
- Eldritch Cone (eldritch blast shape)
- Noxious Blast (eldritch blast essence)

- Vitriolic Blast (eldritch blast essence)

#### Dark
- Dark Discorporation (ravens instead of bats)
- Eldritch Doom (eldritch blast shape)
- Utterdark Blast (eldritch blast essence)
- Word of Changing

#### Homebrew
- Mythic Eldritch Blast: 1d6 + 1 divine damage on eldritch blasts per mythic rank.
  Compared to Kineticist, Warlock's raw damage output is pretty unimpressive. This is a rough attempt to address this. This is subject to change.
- Eldritch Glaive Toggle: optionally can change Eldritch Glaive to a toggle like Kinetic Blade instead of a full-round action.
